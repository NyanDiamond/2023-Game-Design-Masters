VFX ITERATIONS: 


	explosion_vfx

		Occcurence: An explosion that plays when the player triggers the explosive barrel or any other explosive item.
 
		How to implement: Just needs to play when the explosion is triggered. 

		Other notes: Will need to be scaled in code to match whatever size/radius design wants it 

		Status: In game, but needs iteration
	
			Iteration: some of the particles appear way too small, and others too big
