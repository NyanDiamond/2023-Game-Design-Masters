VFX IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE: 


	

	frontImpactBlood_VFX
		
		Occurence: one variation of a blood splatter that will occur when a player (or enemy temporarily) gets hit 
		with a projectile 
		
		How to implement: plays when a player/enemy gets hit with a projectile
	
		Other notes: I'm not quite sure how this will look in game yet. This will probably need iteration on usage

		Status: Not in game 


	sideImpactBlood_LEFT_VFX
		
		Occurence: a variation of a blood splatter that will occur when a player (or enemy temp) gets hit on the 
		LEFT side of their body. 
		
		How to implement: plays when a player/enemy gets hit on the left side of their body 
	
		Other notes: let me know if that's not possible so I can change it. 

		Status: Not in game 


	sideImpactBlood_RIGHT_VFX

		Occurence: a variation of a blood splatter that will occur when a player (or enemy temp) gets hit on the 
		RIGHT side of their body.

		How to implement: plays when a player/enemy gets hit on the left side of their body 
	
		Other notes: let me know if it's not possible 

		Status: Not in game 

	

	defaultProjectile_VFX
	
		Occurence: a temporary asset that can be used for any projectile in the game 

		How to implement: replace current pellet/projectile with updated vfx 

		Other notes: I will be making iterations/variants for different enemy types once we have a more solid idea of what
		that will look like. 

		Status: Not in game 

*the following smoke vfx can be just placed in the environment and adjusted as need: smokeCone_VFX (cone-shaped system), smokeBox_VFX (for larger scale areas), smokeSphere_VFX (for smaller items emitting smoke from its core)
