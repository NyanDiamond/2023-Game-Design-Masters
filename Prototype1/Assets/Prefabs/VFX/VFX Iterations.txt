VFX ITERATIONS: 


	explosion_vfx

		Occcurence: An explosion that plays when the player triggers the explosive barrel or any other explosive item.
 
		How to implement: Just needs to play when the explosion is triggered. 

		Other notes: Will need to be scaled in code to match whatever size/radius design wants it 

		Status: In game, but needs iteration
	
			Iteration: some of the particles appear way too small, and others too big


	flash_dustCloud_VFX
		
		Occurence: This cloud will appear when an object breaks to show the player has broken it 
		
		How to implemenet: Play on an object break 
		
		Other notes: more variations will need to be made eventually to match color and style. This is a base one
		use for now 

		Status: in game 
	
			Iteration: Should only play when an object breaks or collides with another object. This means we'll need a 				different effect for being destroyed by fire
